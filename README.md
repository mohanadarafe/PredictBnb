# PredictBnb

## Abstract
The online home rental industry is a fast-paced market with rental rates changing constantly. For home owners seeking to rent their homes, it is proving to be difficult to evaluate what a fair price is. Luckily, Airbnb provide data of every home rented in the past 5-10 years. In this project, we will build an Airbnb tool (a.k.a PredictBnb) that will help home owners pick a price based on past listings. This will be done via a dataset analysis & machine learning techniques. With this tool, home owners can feel confident of the rate they chose for their homes.
